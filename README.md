# Mathnasium-Session-Note-Writer

The Mathnasium-Session-Note-Writer is a tool created by me during my time working at Mathnasium. It was designed to simplify the process of writing session notes and reduce work-related stress.

## Setup and Usage

There are two files - setup.py and Session_Note_Writer.py. First run and follow the instructions in setup.py. This allows for the program to store your first name and intials so that you don't have to input it in every single time. Then you will be able to run Session_Note_Writer.py. It is pretty simple, has a decent amount of features, and can make working at Mathnasium significantly better!
